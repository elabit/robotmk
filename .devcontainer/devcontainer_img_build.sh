# This script should be executed at the very beginning to craft Docker images based on
# the original Checkmk 1/2 Docker images which also contain Python 3.9 and Robotframework.
#
# 1) Edit build-devcontainer.env and change the variable CMKVERSIONS to your needs.
#    It should only contain CMK versions you want to test/develop on.
# 2) Start build-devcontainer.sh. It will check if the CMK Docker images are already
#    available locally. If not, it asks for credentials to download the
#    image from the CMK download page.
# 3) After the image tgz has been downloaded, it will be imported into Docker.
#    (approx. 5 minutes)
# 4) In the last step, the script will build an image based on the CMK version, including
#    Python3 and robotframework. (approx. 10 minutes)
# $ docker images | grep mk
