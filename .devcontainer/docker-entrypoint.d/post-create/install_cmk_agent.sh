# This script gets executed as a hook after the Docker entrypoint script has 
# created the OMD site.  
# Note: the agent installed here has no relation to the CMK version in this container. 
# As agent installers are only available after the first login into the site, 
# we do not have access to them. Instead, a recent deb gets installed. Will work
# for most needs...  
# As soon as the first installer has been baken by the bakery, the agent will 
# anyhow have a version from the CMK server.
